# External-Apex-Cheat

update : added new function hook and updated offsets (use at own risk)
multiple ban reports within last 12hrs

Install WDK
1) Build in Release x64
2) Map driver using KDMapper
3) Launch Game
4) Run User-mode when in main menu
5) Have Fun 

driver is indeed public/open source (anyone can use it) made by null, so plz dont think some shitty CW trainer really made this...
glow was made by @AdrianVPL, any p2c use this or skidded version's of it. myself put this together too provide a simple cheat people can use while it stays UD
if your any good with function hooking in kernel you could possibly make this a better driver.

my discord if you have issue :  $urge got tapped#4481

if your on 2004 download the supported kdmapper found on the interwebs somewhere.. not rocket science ;)
enjoy 

updated to new game version

status: Testing (Multiple Ban Reports)

small bugs fixed
